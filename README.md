# Collab-Filtering-Recommendation
Set of simple scripts for generating recommendations based on user ratings on a dataset of TV shows and movies. Since no user data was available, the script creates a random set of ratings, and uses some techniques to calculate user or item based similarity and generate recommendations for a given user of interest
Also consists of data sets of TV shows and movies taken from Kaggle that were used to create a consolidated list of Indian language items for a test run for distribution among freinds for soliciting ratings
